			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p class="instructions">
				The purpose of this technique is to notify Assistive Technologies (AT) when content has been updated with  information about the user's or application's status. The aria role of status has an implicit aria-live value of polite, which allows a user to be notified via AT (such as a screen reader)  when status messages are added. The role of status also has an aria-atomic value of true, so that updates to the region marked with a role of status will result in the AT presenting the entire contents of the region to the user, including any author-defined label. The content within the aria-live region is automatically read by the AT, without the AT having to focus on the place where the text is displayed. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#status">WAI-ARIA 1.1 status (role)</a> for more details.

Code samples should be elided if necessary to show the core of the technique without necessarily providing all the surrounding code that would also be involved. A working example link references a location where the technique can be shown working live.</p>
